/*
 *  Structs and classes are almost exactly the same. But, there are 2 major
 *  1) There is no inheritance in structs
 *  2) (MOST IMPORTANT) Structs are value types, and classes are value types
 *      - value types get copied (arrays, ints, strings, are all struct examples)
 *          - swift does copy on write semantics
 *      - reference types: lives in the heap, has pointers to it
 *          - when you pass it around, you just pass pointers to it
 *
 *  Structs also get a free initializer, it initalizes all of their vars (but you have
 *  to actually go through and set them all)
